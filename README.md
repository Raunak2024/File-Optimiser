We use the Huffman Coding algorithm for this purpose which is a greedy algorithm that assigns variable length binary codes for each input character in the text file. The length of the binary code depends on the frequency of the character in the file. The algorithm suggests creating a binary tree where all the unique characters of a file are stored in the treeâ€™s leaf node
